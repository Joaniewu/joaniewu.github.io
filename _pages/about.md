<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a postdoc at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I received my Ph.D. degree at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), advised by [Prof. Xu Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/xcsysu/) in 2023. 

My research interests lie in federated learning, mobile edge computing, large language model in telecom domain and social data analytics.
